    "# Introduction to Pandas\n",

    "\n",
    "- Understand the logic behind CSV files, especially as it relates to Python's ability to parse the file format (header row, no extraneous columns, etc.).\n",
    "- Recognize the importance of using relative paths to files (rather than absolute paths).\n",
    "- Understand the structure of a data frame in Python\n",
    "- Be able to load in a csv to Python and perform basic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pandas Library\n",
    "\n",
    "To read csv files, python provides a really good library called pandas. Here, I am looking at a diabetes dataset and I want to load the file into python and then explore the data within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a library in python, we often write: \n",
    "\n",
    "    import (library name) as (shortened version). \n",
    "\n",
    "For Pandas we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we need python to use functions from the pandas library we will have `pd.(command)` rather than `pandas.(command)`. Just think of all the time you'll save by typing four fewer characters?"

    "We're writing code. There isn't a button to click that says \"Import Dataset\". You can't just click around until you find the correct folder with your data in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you have to know where your data is. Before you start any data science project, take a minute to organize your file system so you always know where your data are. [This blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/manage-your-data-science-project-structure-in-early-stage-95f91d4d0600) provides some opinions on a good file system structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start Python, it runs in a folder somewhere. It has access to all the files in that folder. If the dataset \"diabetes-train.csv\" is in the same folder as Python, then you can access the file simply by using the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the data might be in another folder. For instance, suppose you have the following folder structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Root Project Folder\n",
    "    - Data\n",
    "        - Raw\n",
    "            - diabetes.csv\n",

    "        - Preparation\n",
    "            - diabetes-clean.py\n",
    "            - diabetes-make-train.py\n",
    "        - Exploration\n",
    "            - diabetes-vis.py\n",
    "\n",
    "If python is in the Root Project Folder, you'll need to open the file \"Data/Cleaned/diabetes-train.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead python is in the Exploration folder, you'll need to move back through some folders first. To do this, you use the special command \"..\", which is like the back button on your browser. The file can be opened with \"../../Data/Cleaned/diabetes-train.csv\". The first \"..\" moves you to the SourceCode folder, the second moves you to the Root Project Folder, and then we head back down the folders to the right directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should **NEVER** use paths that start with \"C:/Users/me/myfiles/\" (this is called an *absolute path*, as opposed to the *relative paths* above). As a data scientist, you might share this project with someone. When you do, absolute paths **will not work**. \n",
