    "Python is a general-purpose language. There are tons of people using it for tons of different things in tons of different ways.

    "1. NEVER COPY/PASTE\n",
    "    - You learn nothing unless you've written it yourself.\n",
    "2. ALWAYS CHECK THE RESULTS\n",
    "    - Python is interactive; interact with it! Look at what you created, find out what you can do with it, learn it's properties.\n",
    "3. SAVE OFTEN\n",
    "    - Should be self-explanatory. Python doesn't auto-save anything.\n",
    "4. BREAK IT\n",
    "    - At this level, there's very, very little that you can do that will affect your computer at all, let alone in a negative way. As long as you're SAVING YOUR CODE OFTEN, you can just reboot and fix any changes that you can't undo.\n",
    "5. TEACH IT\n",
    "    - Teaching it forces you to evaluate what you know and how well you know it. It also helps to create your own examples so that you can't just copy/paste code from what you've seen."
